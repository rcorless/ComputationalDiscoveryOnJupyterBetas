    "This collection of notebooks is mostly numerical, with not a lot of exact or symbolic computation.  Why not?  And, for that matter, why is numerical computing (even with all the unexpected behaviour of floating-point arithmetic) so much more popular than symbolic or exact computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explores symbolic computation and its pitfalls.  We do so from the point of view of experience and with some authority: we have used symbolic computation (usually in Maple, but also in other symbolic languages) for years (decades!) and know it and its benefits well. <b>Caveat: We do not know SymPy so well, and so if we say that SymPy <i>can't</i> do something, we may well be wrong.</b> \n",

    "One of RMC's earliest co-authors, Honglin Ye, put it well when he suggested that not everyone needs numerical methods but that <i>everyone</i> could use symbolic computation.\n",

    "    <LI> Symbolic computation systems are hard to learn how to use well, because there's a lot to learn (indeed, you kind of have to know the math first, too).  Look at the <A HREF=\"https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/index.html\">SymPy Tutorial</A> for example. It has ten sections, one labeled \"Gotchas\". The SAGEMATH system, which also works with Python, is both more powerful and more complicated: <A HREF=\"https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/\">See the SAGEMATH Tutorial </A> to get started there.</LI>\n",

    "    <LI> \"Symbolic Computation\" and \"Computer Algebra\" are related terms---about as close as \"Numerical Analysis\" and \"Computational Science\" if that comparison means anything---but the differences are remarkably important, because what gets <i>implemented</i> is usually a Computer Algebra system, whereas what people actually <i>want to use</i> is a symbolic computation system.  We'll show you what that means.</LI>\n",
    "    <LI> Symbolic computation systems are hard to implement well.  The major systems (Maple, Mathematica, and Matlab) charge money for their products, and get what they ask for; this is because their systems are better than the free ones in many respects, because they have invested significant programmer time to address the inherent difficulties.  Free systems, such as SymPy, will do the easy things for you; and we will see that they can be useful.  But in reality there's no comparison (although we admit that the SAGEMATH people may well disagree with our opinion).</LI>\n",

Maple's help pages cite three important papers, and tell you that it uses an algorithm called the quadratic sieve.  Maple can factor $45000000000000000057990000000000000024761900000000000003506217$ into its three prime factors in about 7.5 seconds on this machine; in contrast, after fifty minutes running trying to factor that with factorint as above, RMC had to hard-restart to get Python's attention. \n",

An \"affordance\" is a word meaning \"something can happen with it\": for instance, you can pick out a lowest-degree term; or you can add it to another polynomial; or you can square it; and so on.

For degree $5$ polynomials, there <i>is</i> a solution in terms of elliptic functions; again, it's complicated enough that it's of questionable use.  Then there is Galois theory which describes the algebraic structures of polynomials.

    "As of this writing, many computer algebra systems (not just SymPy) are broken by this example.  Maple's indefinite integral returns something that looks a little nicer, namely\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int f(x)\\,dx = 2 \\arctan \\! \\left(\\frac{\\tan \\! \\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)}{3}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "but when you evaluate that at $x=2\\pi$ you get the same value that you do at $x=0$, because the function is <i>periodic</i>.  So the difference is, as with SymPy's answer, wrongly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is something very important happening in that expression, though, which also happens in that more complex expression returned by SymPy: there is a jump discontinuity at $x=\\pi$.  The computer algebra system has returned a <i>discontinuous</i> function as an antiderivative of a <i>continuous</i> function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone remember the tl;dr of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus?  Likely not.  Even we have to look it up before we teach it, to be sure we have the fine details right.  The basic idea is, though, that integration <i>smooths</i> things out: integrate a continuous function, you get a <i>continuously differentiable</i> function, which is smoother.  Jump discontinuities spuriously introduced are <i>right out</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what the computer algebra system is doing there <i>is not integration</i>.  Anyone get their knuckles rapped for not adding the \"constant of integration\" when you integrated on a test?  Lost a mark or two, maybe?\n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out that's what's going on here.  By adding <i>different constants</i> in <i>different intervals</i> to this purported antiderivative, we can find a smooth antiderivative of $f(x)$.  The answer returned by SymPy (and Maple) is \"correct\" from the point of view of differential algebra, where constants are things that differentiate to zero and don't have \"values\" as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people who implement computer algebra systems (even some of our friends at Maple) argue that they are right and we are wrong, and don't see the point.  But they are wrong, and one day they'll get it.  Now, they do have a fix-up in their <i>definite</i> integration code: if you ask Maple int( f, x=0..2\\*Pi) you will get the correct answer $2\\pi$.  But you have to ask the right way, by using the syntax for definite integrals (as you see above, SymPy does not give the right answer that way). \n",
    "\n",
    "Matlab gets it.  Matlab's Symbolic Toolbox works quite hard to get continuous antiderivatives.  So we have confidence that Maple will one day get it. But Wolfram Alpha gets a discontinuous antiderivative, too, at this time of writing, so there's only a <i>little</i> pressure from the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "These facts have been known for quite a while now.  See <A HREF=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2690852.pdf\">The Importance of Being Continuous</A> by David Jeffrey, a paper that was written in 1994 (long predating Python or SymPy).\n",
    "\n",
    "The disagreement amongst mathematicians---algebra versus analysis---has been going on for much longer, and goes at least back to Cauchy.  We are on Cauchy's side, here.  But there are lots of people who just want formulas, and don't care if they are discontinuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "RMC retweeted something apropos this morning: Prof Michael Kinyon said \"I used to think it was weird when people disagreed with me, but now I understand that some people just enjoy the feeling of being wrong.\"\n",
